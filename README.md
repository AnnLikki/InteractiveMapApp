Interactive Map is a desktop app written in Python using QT library. 

This is an application for creating interactive maps by importing images and adding dynamic markers with names, descriptions and numerous icons. 

It is oriented to track the maps of table top games, for example D&D, so the marker icons were chosen so that they fit the medieval and fantasy themes.

I haven't understood how to export python projects yet, so this is a plan for the future. I would be grateful for testing, suggesting improvements and bug reporting in Issues.
