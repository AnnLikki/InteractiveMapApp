Interactive Map is a desktop app written in Python (I'm sorry) using QT library. It provides an ability to import a picture and add customizable markers to it with icons, labels and descriptions.

Points to note:
1. All markers and UI images are up for change, since it was a quick scramble for a proof of concept.
2. More functionality to come, for example an ability to scale markers.
